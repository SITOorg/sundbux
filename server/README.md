# notes

probably want to do some kind of lightweight **json store**, such as:

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-json-store / https://github.com/alexkwolfe/json-fs-store ( ??? https://github.com/vladimiry/fs-json-store )
* https://github.com/typicode/lowdb
* https://parseplatform.org/


# "sandbox database"

work on _sanitized_ **copy of sito db**, converted to **json**.  use this on some sito-based server.

make an **empty** version (i.e. same schema, only test data) for inclusion via git.

expose as own (read-only? writeable?) api ... or via the above api?
